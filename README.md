Simple chat for local network written in Go, mostly as a test

To run(for now): 
	go run ./server/server.go ./server/user.go
 	go run ./client/client.go

  	(again, for now) If you want to launch 2 clients from 1 host, then run one client, then change "localhost" on line 23 of client.go file to your ip address, then run the second client.
At least it works!
